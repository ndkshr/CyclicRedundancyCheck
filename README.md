# CyclicRedundancyCheck
Given a binary message and a generator function, it can create a CRC encoded binary message with added redundancy bits for transmission.

PS: I coded it while my semester 5 exams, so the generator funcntion has to be fed in manually as binary (hope you know how to do that!)
i hate doing things manually! but exceptions have to be made.
